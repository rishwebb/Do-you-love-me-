# 💖 Do You Love Me? – Flying No Button

A playful and humorous interactive website that asks a simple question: **“Do you love me?”** 💕

But there’s a twist 👀
The **“No”** button refuses to be clicked and keeps flying away whenever the user tries to reach it. The only possible choice is **“Yes”**, making the experience fun, cute, and slightly evil 😄❤️

## ✨ Features

* Interactive and funny user experience
* “No” button dynamically escapes the cursor
* “Yes” button remains clickable
* Cute illustration and soft pastel UI
* Smooth button movement animations
* Fully client-side, no backend required

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Structure
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript** – Button movement logic

---

## 🚀 How It Works

* When the user moves the cursor toward the **No** button, JavaScript randomly changes its position on the screen
* This makes the **No** button impossible to click
* Clicking **Yes** triggers the intended response

Simple logic, maximum fun 😄
